at cbil, here is a link to the toy site:   
http://demeter.pcbi.upenn.edu/wdk-dev/index.jsp

the overall spec for the default view is that the user configures their  
site by providing:
    - a model
    - a logo
    - a header
    - a footer
    - a stylesheet
the user does not have to touch any .jsp file at all for a sensible  
site to come up.   (they can if they want to of course)

here is the list of adjustments we think are needed for the default view:

intro page
-- get rid of it

questionSet page:
-- see allgenes for a sample: http://www.allgenes.org/query.html
-- model:  add a "description" tag to describe the whole model. 
   If present in the model, it should be displayed as text at the top of this page.
   ("Welcome to blah blah.   We have great data.  Try our queries...")  
-- the .jsp that makes this page is not generic.  it references the set name directly.    
-- instead it should show all question sets available in the model, each with its own submit button
-- loose the reset button
-- replace submit button with go
-- each questionSet should show the question set's description

question page:
-- see plasmodb for sample:  
http://www.plasmodb.org/plasmodb/servlet/sv?page=geneQueries&showForm=1&query=genesByFunction
-- show the question's display name as banner for page
-- model:  add a description attribute to Question
-- show question's description up into the top text area
-- offer a link to the question's help text
-- right justify param prompts
-- for each param, offer a link to its help text
-- change SubmitQuery to Submit

summary page:
-- paging:  unlink and highlight the current page; lose the explicit mention of next/prev page numbers (like google)
-- display total number of results found
-- display description of query w/ param values,
-- leftmost column header should be "<RecordType> Identifier" instead  of "primary_key"
-- leftmost column should be a link of the form DT.12345   where DT is the record's idPrefix and 12345 is the primary key
-- improve justification in header and rows

details page:
-- use display name for attribute keys, not internal attribute names
-- display table values:
     - each table shown in an html table
     - each is broken off into its own section, with a header that shows the table's description
-- banner should say "<RecordType> <Identifier>" if possible

WDKTestSite problems
-- if model has bad sql (eg select x, y, from T), the site simply shows
   blanks (side by side with results of other queries, if any)
-- changes in the database (eg list of taxons) does not get picked up
   until webapp reload (wdkCache reset does not help)

testModelRNG.xml:

-- rename to: toyModel.xml
-- rename model to toyModel and loose all WTS prefixes
-- move summarySet to top
-- name summarySet "RnaSummaries"
-- loose prefixes in summary names
-- only one record: RnaRecord (has is summary status)
-- name recordSet: RnaRecords with one Record: RnaRecord
-- put all 5 RnaQueries in same querySet
-- put all Rna Record attribute queries in one set
-- put all Rna Record table queries in one set
-- use xml commenting to comment all sets and queries
-- keep query set for params (vocabqueries)
-- preference is to have summary and query with the same name
-- all params should use prompts and help, and sample if necessary
-- keep one paramSet until it is necessary to divide
-- loose queries to minimize the need to extend toy db
-- keep at least one query that uses more than one param, 
   and one that use vocab param, and one that uses '>'
