       <attribute attributeFieldRef="description" value="CryptoDB is now part of an NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Center to provide Apicomplexan Database Resources. This release represents a major upgrade of the database software and as a result we can provide greater search power. We now offer searches by gene and contig name in addition to key word and protein features. Results are displayed graphically and provide additional useful information for each gene or contig. We have added a GBrowse display that allows you to zoom in to the nucleotide level and we have added a comparative GBrowse view comparing C. parvum and C. hominis contigs. Please explore the site and provide feedback and suggestions to help@cryptodb.org."/>
