# This is a SAMPLE file.  You must provide your values to correctly configure your use.
# To fully understand this file run the generateFilesFromTemplates command with no arguments

# This section provides required meta-config properties.  They are used to configure the masterConfig.yaml file.
# The values here are substituted into macros in masterConfig.yaml file (not directly into the template files)

required:

  # The name of your project
  project: TemplateDB

  # User name for the application database
  appDb.login: wdktemplatedb

  # Password for the application database
  appDb.password: <db_password>

  # Instance name of application database
  appDb.instance: wdktemplatedb

  # Database link for user database
  appDb.userDbLink:

  # User name for user database
  userDb.login: wdktemplatedb

  # Password for user database

  gushome: $ENV{GUS_HOME}


# This section is used to specify sections to use, other than `default`,
# from masterConfig.yaml. If no other sections are necessary, you can simply
# make this an empty array:
#
#     sections: []
#
sections:
  - templatedb


# This section overrides all key/values in masterConfig.yaml. It lets you make a
# non-standard configuration as needed. For instance, you might want to override
# the WDK engine schema. You can do that here with the following example:
#
#     custom:
#       wdkEngineSchema: wdkenginedev.
